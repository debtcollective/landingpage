  title: "What is The Debt Collective?"
  text:
    - "Today most of us are in debt. No matter how much we work or how hard we try to get ahead, we are barely getting by. We are struggling to get out from under student debt, medical debt, payday loans, housing debt, criminal justice debt, credit card debt, and more. For too long, we've experienced these debts in fear and isolation, while others get rich off of our monthly payments."
    - "The Debt Collective is here to say, no more!"
  caption: "The Debt Collective leverages collective power by offering debtors a shared platform for direct action."
